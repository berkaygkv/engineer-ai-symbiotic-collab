## Current Phase

Bootstrapping the meta-workflow environment.

**Active focus:** Layer 1 (design-process infrastructure) — core protocols and document structures

**Next anticipated focus:** Begin Layer 2 (the designed product) — the actual workflow for Claude Code

## Active Decisions

| ID | Decision | Date | Context |
|----|----------|------|---------|
| D001 | This is meta-work; we build the environment, not execute within it | 2025-06-19 | Fundamental distinction governing all current activity |
| D002 | Decision authority model: Flag and wait | 2025-06-19 | Claude recommends with confidence level; Human decides |
| D003 | ARCHIVE.md updated at session end only, never loaded at start | 2025-06-19 | Prevents context pollution |
| D004 | STATE.md stays lean—only active, relevant items | 2025-06-19 | Superseded items transition to ARCHIVE |
| D005 | Date format: YYYY-MM-DD | 2025-06-19 | Consistency across all documents |
| D006 | Confirmation required before capturing to persistent documents | 2025-06-19 | Prevents misrepresentation of intent |
| D007 | GLOSSARY.md loaded at every session start | 2025-06-19 | Prevents terminology drift across sessions |

## Open Items

| ID | Item | Urgency | Waiting On | Notes |
|----|------|---------|------------|-------|
| O001 | Begin Layer 2 design work | High | Next session | Layer 1 infrastructure complete |
| O002 | Determine if ROLES.md is needed separately | Low | Future review | May be redundant with CLAUDE-OPERATING.md |

## Active Insights

| ID | Insight | Date | Implications |
|----|---------|------|--------------|
| I001 | Confidence level signaling improves recommendation quality | 2025-06-19 | Embedded in CLAUDE-OPERATING.md as standard practice |
| I002 | Curated persistence > exhaustive persistence | 2025-06-19 | Core tension; shapes all capture decisions |
| I003 | Small game-changing details can outweigh lengthy exposition | 2025-06-19 | Active extraction required during sessions |
| I004 | Layer 1 vs Layer 2 require explicit ongoing distinction; blur easily | 2025-06-19 | Must verify which layer we're operating on; led to Layer column in inventory |
| I005 | Glossary prevents conceptual blur; defined terms persist across sessions | 2025-06-19 | Led to GLOSSARY.md creation |

## Integrity Notes

- None currently. Layer 1 baseline established.
