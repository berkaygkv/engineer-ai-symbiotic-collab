### Claude Code Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md` | `/bootstrap` — Start session with full context load |
| `.claude/commands/handoff.md` | `/handoff` — End session with proper state capture |
| `.claude/commands/status.md` | `/status` — Quick state check |
| `.claude/commands/log-decision.md` | `/log-decision` — Capture confirmed decision |
| `.claude/commands/log-gap.md` | `/log-gap` — Log knowledge gap |

## Active Decisions

| ID | Decision | Date | Context |
|----|----------|------|---------|
| D001 | This is meta-work; we build the environment, not execute within it | 2025-06-19 | Fundamental distinction governing all current activity |
| D002 | Decision authority model: Flag and wait | 2025-06-19 | Claude recommends with confidence level; Human decides |
| D003 | ARCHIVE.md updated at session end only, never loaded at start | 2025-06-19 | Prevents context pollution |
| D004 | STATE.md stays lean—only active, relevant items | 2025-06-19 | Superseded items transition to ARCHIVE |
| D005 | Date format: YYYY-MM-DD | 2025-06-19 | Consistency across all documents |
| D006 | Confirmation required before capturing to persistent documents | 2025-06-19 | Prevents misrepresentation of intent |
| D007 | GLOSSARY.md loaded at every session start | 2025-06-19 | Prevents terminology drift across sessions |
| D008 | Claude Code is the operational platform for this workflow | 2025-06-19 | Setup complete with CLAUDE.md and custom commands |

## Open Items

| ID | Item | Urgency | Waiting On | Notes |
|----|------|---------|------------|-------|
| O001 | First production session using the workflow | High | Human initiative | Platform ready; test the full cycle |
| O002 | Determine if ROLES.md is needed separately | Low | Future review | May be redundant with CLAUDE-OPERATING.md |
| O003 | Refine slash commands based on actual usage | Medium | Post-first-session | May need adjustments after testing |

## Active Insights

| ID | Insight | Date | Implications |
|----|---------|------|--------------|
| I001 | Confidence level signaling improves recommendation quality | 2025-06-19 | Embedded in CLAUDE-OPERATING.md as standard practice |
| I002 | Curated persistence > exhaustive persistence | 2025-06-19 | Core tension; shapes all capture decisions |
| I003 | Small game-changing details can outweigh lengthy exposition | 2025-06-19 | Active extraction required during sessions |
| I004 | Layer 1 vs Layer 2 require explicit ongoing distinction; blur easily | 2025-06-19 | Must verify which layer we're operating on |
| I005 | Glossary prevents conceptual blur; defined terms persist across sessions | 2025-06-19 | Led to GLOSSARY.md creation |
| I006 | Slash commands enable repeatable workflow actions | 2025-06-19 | /bootstrap, /handoff, /status now available |
