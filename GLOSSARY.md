## Layers

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Layer 1** | Design-process infrastructure. The protocols, tools, and documents we use *while designing*. Scaffolding for the work, not the product. |
| **Layer 2** | The designed product. The actual workflow/environment that will eventually live in Claude Code. The output of our design work. |

---

## Modes

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Meta-work** | The act of designing the environment rather than executing within it. Building the system, not using it. Current mode of this collaboration. |
| **Planning mode** | Collaborative design sessions where we build up steps, documents, knowledge, and blueprints. Declared at project outset. |

---

## Documents

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **STATE.md** | Living anchor. Current operational truth. Lean by design—only active, relevant items. |
| **ARCHIVE.md** | Cold storage for parked or superseded items. Updated at session end only. Never loaded at session start. |
| **KNOWLEDGE-GAPS.md** | Research queue. Tracks what we don't know but need to, and assumptions we're proceeding on. |
| **CLAUDE-OPERATING.md** | Claude's cognitive and behavioral protocols for this collaboration. |
| **PROTOCOL-SESSION.md** | Governs session lifecycle: start, working, and handoff procedures. |
| **GLOSSARY.md** | This document. Shared terminology. |

## Signal Words

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **DECISION** | A choice has been made and is in effect. |
| **OPEN** | Unresolved matter requiring future attention. |
| **PARKED** | Valid idea, but not for now. Candidate for archive. |
| **DRAFT** | Proposed, not yet agreed. |
| **GAP** | Knowledge needed; research required. |
| **ASSUMED** | Proceeding on assumption. Noted with confidence level and risk. |
| **INSIGHT** | Small but significant realization worth preserving. |

---

## Confidence Levels

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Strong confidence** | Claude believes this is correct/valuable. Would advocate for it. |
| **Moderate confidence** | Reasonable basis, but not certain. Worth considering. |
| **Uncertain if helpful** | Offering because it might be relevant, but unsure of value. |
| **Weak confidence** | Speculative. Flagged for completeness, not advocated. |

---

## Roles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Executive Assistant** | Claude role: documentation, note-taking, updates, cleanup. Discerning about what to capture. |
| **Research Collaborator** | Claude role: thought partnership, clarification, challenge. Professorial, not adversarial. |
| **Product Owner** | Claude role: planning, task tracking, alignment to goals. Strategic, maintains coherence. |

---

## Processes

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Bootstrap** | Session start procedure. Load documents, confirm state, surface open items. |
| **Handoff** | Session end procedure. Summary, decisions, insights, archive transitions, next focus. |
| **Confirmation Before Capture** | Verification step before anything goes into persistent documents. "Capturing this as [X]. Correct?" |
| **Archive Transition** | Movement of superseded/parked items from STATE.md to ARCHIVE.md. Happens at session end only. |

---

## Principles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Curated persistence** | Capture what matters, discard what doesn't, archive what might. Core tension of documentation. |
| **Pollution** | Noise in documents or context. Expensive; costs future clarity. Anti-pattern. |
| **Distill wisely** | Capture essence, not volume. Small insights may outweigh lengthy exposition. |
