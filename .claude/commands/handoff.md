Prepare session handoff by summarizing work and updating persistent documents.

Generate:
1. **Session Summary** — Distilled discussion of what was accomplished
2. **Decisions Made** — With DECISION markers (should have been confirmed during session)
3. **Insights Captured** — Game-changers, including small ones
4. **Knowledge Gaps Identified** — What needs research
5. **Open Items** — Unresolved matters
6. **Archive Transitions** — Items to move from STATE to ARCHIVE (confirm before moving)
7. **Document Updates** — What was created/modified this session
8. **Next Session Suggested Focus**

Then update STATE.md with:
- New decisions
- Updated open items
- New insights
- Modified document inventory

Finally, update ARCHIVE.md with any transitioned items.
