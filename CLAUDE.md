# Claude Code Project Instructions

Symbiotic collaboration workflow. Read STATE.md at session start to understand current context.

## Core Docs
- **CLAUDE-OPERATING.md** — Your behavioral protocols
- **STATE.md** — Current operational truth
- **GLOSSARY.md** — Shared terminology

## Key Rules
- Confirm before capturing decisions: "Capturing this as [X]. Correct?"
- Keep STATE.md lean — only active items
- Flag conflicts between documents immediately
- Use `/handoff` at session end to preserve state
